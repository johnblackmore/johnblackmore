## Hi there, I'm John 👋

I'm a software (and digital marketing) consultant who specialises in re-platforming bespoke PHP web applications onto [Laravel](https://laravel.com/).

Over the last 10 years I have built:

- 👷‍♂️ a business insurance quote engine for tradespeople
- 🏦 an online accounting SaaS platform
- 🤑 a voucher codes and deals website
- 📈 an equity crowdfunding platform
- 🏠 a property lettings management system
- 📊 a big-data property intelligence platform
- ⛳️ an international golf course reviews website
- 🚐 a bespoke customer-relations B2B platform for a leisure industry supplier

I work remotely from my home office in West Somerset (that's in England). 

I am available for freelance projects to work in a consultant or project manager capacity, along with my team of trusted developers. You can contact me via:

- [LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/johnblackmore)

In my spare time I travel the UK with my family in our self-converted VW campervan. You can follow our adventures on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/t4.family/) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/T4Family).
