## Hi there, I'm John 👋

I am currently working as Head of Technology at [Wonderful Payments](https://wonderful.co.uk) and [Wonderful Org](https://wonderful.org).
I specialise in managing remote-working development teams and re-platforming bespoke PHP web applications onto [Laravel](https://laravel.com/).

Over the last 15 years I have built:

- 👷‍♂️ a business insurance quote engine for tradespeople
- 🏦 an online accounting SaaS platform
- 🤑 a voucher codes and deals website
- 📈 an equity crowdfunding platform
- 🏠 a property lettings management system
- 📊 a big-data property intelligence platform
- ⛳️ an international golf course reviews website
- 🚐 a bespoke customer-relations B2B platform for a leisure industry supplier
- 💷 an A2A payments platform powered by Open Banking

I work remotely from my home office in West Somerset (that's in England).
